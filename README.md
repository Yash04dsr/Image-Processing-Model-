# Image-Processing-Model
*************************************************************************************************
This is an Machine learning Image processing model developed**using Nueral Network** by the help of **TensorFlow**which can predict the class of fashion wear by using the image with an **accuracy of 90 percent**.

**************************************************************************************************
The data set used to train the model and test the model is imported from **fashion_mnist** platform
this data set having the training  60000 images of 28x28 pixels and **10000 test images** of the same.
**As a user of the model:-**
<br>
1) Just enter the index(anything between **0 to 10000**) of picture which you want our model to predict.
   
2) And just hit the enter butten.
you will see your selected model's the rough picure(plotted by matplotlib) and its real class and the predicted class guess by our model.
